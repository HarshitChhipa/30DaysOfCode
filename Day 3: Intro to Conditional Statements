Problem :- 

Given an integer, , perform the following conditional actions:
If  is odd, print Weird
If  is even and in the inclusive range of  to , print Not Weird
If  is even and in the inclusive range of  to , print Weird
If  is even and greater than , print Not Weird
Complete the stub code provided in your editor to print whether or not  is weird.

Now this problem can be solved by many ways.
Like simply i could have write if and else statements and that will be suffcient.
Now thats the tricky part here we can do this thing in a line without any complexity(If else also don't have complexity however if we talk about amount of code) and
much line of codes.
We could have done it using the ternery statement.

# Like this 
  (N%2 == 1 || (N > 5 && N < 21)) ? console.log('Weird'): console.log('Not Weird');
