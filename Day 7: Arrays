Problem :-
Given an array, , of  integers, print 's elements in reverse order as a single line of space-separated numbers.

Solution :-
This one liner i wrote.
It just it increases the complexity there will be one loop for reverse() then one for joining it so eventually there will be
2 loop.
console.log(arr.reverse().join(' '));

I am figuring it out to do it in one for loop.
