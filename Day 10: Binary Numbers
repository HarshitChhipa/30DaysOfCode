console.log(n.toString(2).split('0').sort((a, b) => a < b)[0].length);

# One which was tried by me and couldn't pass test to still need to figure out my way of doing it.


    let noOf1s = 0;
    binaryArray.forEach((number,index) => {
    if(number ===1 ){
        if(binaryArray[index+1] === 1){       
        noOf1s++;
        } else {
            return;
        }
    } else {
        return;
    }    
    });
    console.log(noOf1s);
