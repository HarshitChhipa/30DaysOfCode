Problem :- 
Given a string, , of length  that is indexed from  to , print its even-indexed and odd-indexed characters as  
space-separated strings on a single line (see the Sample below for more detail).
Note:  is considered to be an even index.

(This was pain my ass as after reading a discussion i figure it out that I have split in in a new line and then loop through it)
Sample Input :-
2
Hacker
Rank

Solution :-
input.split("\n").map((mainInput,indexOfMainInput) => {
        if(indexOfMainInput > 0){
        let evenString = [];
        let oddString = [];
        mainInput.split("").map(((splittedMainInput,indexOfsplittedMainInput) =>{
        if(indexOfsplittedMainInput == 0 || (indexOfsplittedMainInput %2) === 0 ){
            evenString.push(splittedMainInput)
        }else{ oddString.push(splittedMainInput)}
        }))
        console.log(evenString.join("")+' '+oddString.join(""));
        }
    });
{Although I am trying to improve it, lets see how much we can optimize it}
